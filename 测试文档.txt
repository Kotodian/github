Don¡¯t talk like one of them, you¡¯re not! Even if you¡¯d like to be. 
To them,you¡¯re just a freak¨Clike me. They need you right now. 
When they don¡¯t¡­they¡¯ll cast you out. Like a leper. See, their morals, 
their code: it¡¯s a bad joke. They¡¯re dropped at the first sign of trouble.
 They¡¯re only as good as the world allows them to be. 
You¡¯ll see, when the chips are down these civilized people will eat each other.
